    ["How can you check if a file is readable by the user using `lstat`?", "You can check if a file is readable by the user by performing a bitwise AND operation between `attributes.st_mode` and the `S_IRUSR` flag. If the result is non-zero, the file is readable by the user. "],
    ["What is the distinction between ANSI C library functions and POSIX system calls for file operations?", "ANSI C library functions are available in any ANSI compatible C environment, while POSIX system calls are available on POSIX compliant systems. POSIX calls are system-specific and might not be portable to other systems (e.g., partly not to Windows), but they are direct OS calls and can perform more OS-specific tasks. "],
    ["Provide an example of a POSIX file operation for creating a file.", "A POSIX file operation for creating a file is `fd = open(path, O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_WRONLY, mode)`, where `mode` comes from the `chmod` system call. "],
    ["How do you perform a read operation using POSIX calls?", "To perform a read operation using POSIX calls, you use `b_read = read(fd, &buf, n_bytes)`, where `fd` is the file descriptor, `&buf` is the buffer to read into, and `n_bytes` is the number of bytes to read. "],
    ["What POSIX call is used to delete a file?", "The POSIX call used to delete a file is `s = unlink(path)`. "],
    ["What POSIX call is used to create a directory?", "The POSIX call used to create a directory is `s = mkdir(path, mode)`. "],
